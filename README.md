# Documentation:

Managment of KIS instances:
```
/var/www
    /framework
    /kis_data
        /<kunde-1>
            /<modules>
            /<customstyle>
        /<kunde-2>
            /<modules>
            /<customstyle>
        ...   
```
Then a Reverse Proxy: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/ from kunde.kis.intranetproject.net to kis.intranetproject.net/kunde
So in the KIS the content for the correct kunde get loaded and returned to the user.

The Main framework is only one folder but also gets pulled by a gitlab runner. commit to github -> webhook to gitlab -> execute runner -> pull repo

Modules get updated by running a gitlab-runner script that loops through customers modules folder and matches the name to then pull it.

## Notification Handler
We offer a class that helps with Notification handling.
```php
<?php

include("/php/database.php");
$db = new DB();

include("/php/Notification.php");
$notification = new Notification($db);

// Add Notification
$notification->addNotification($userid, $text);

// Get All Notifications
$notification->getNotification();

// Remove Notification
$notification->removeNotification($user, $id);
```
