# Documentation:

Managment of KIS Instances:
```
/var/www
    /framework
    /kis_data
        /<kunde-1>
            /<modules>
            /<customstyle>
        /<kunde-2>
            /<modules>
            /<customstyle>
        ...   
```
Then a Reverse Proxy: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/ from kunde.kis.intranetproject.net to kis.intranetproject.net/kunde
So in the KIS the content for the correct kunde get loaded and returned to the user.

The Main framework is only one folder but also gets pulled by a gitlab runner. commit to github -> webhook to gitlab -> execute runner -> pull repo

Modules get updated by running a gitlab-runner script that loops through customers modules folder and matches the name to then pull it.
