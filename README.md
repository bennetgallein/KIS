`git clone https://github.com/bennetgallein/KIS.git`
2. rename the `config.json.example` to `config.json` an edit at least the `database` section.
3. The `modules` attribute is the basepath of the modules folder where all the modules are located. Changed the accordingly
4. The `url` is the Basepath of the KIS. Here enter the full path where the KIS folder is located.
5. Visit the URL `{kis_base_bath}/setup/setup.php` and enter any license. License checking has been disabled with this update.

## Notification Handler
We offer a class that helps with Notification handling.
```php
<?php

include("/php/database.php");
$db = new DB();

include("/php/Notification.php");
$notification = new Notification($db);

// Add Notification
$notification->addNotification($userid, $text);

// Get All Notifications
$notification->getNotification();

// Remove Notification
$notification->removeNotification($user, $id);
```
